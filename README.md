# node-express-spotify-auth
*Node Express app that handles token exchange for the Spotify Authorization Code flow*

> **Note**: For more information about Spotify Authorization, please visit https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/

## Create your Spotify App
Visit the Spotify developer portal (https://developer.spotify.com/) and create an application setting a CLIENT_ID, SECRET and CALLBACK_URI. 

`CLIENT_ID` - is generated by Spotify

`CLIENT_SECRET` - also generated by spotify

`CALLBACK_URI` - This Url should match the callback route of this hosted application 
  e.g (https://myspotauth/callback) or localhost:5000/callback for local development callbacks.

## Setting Env variables to match your App
There's a `.env.defaults` file with the keys of required environment vars in. This file can be updated and renamed to simply .env for local development. 

Within Heroku, the environment vars can be set via the CLI, for example: `heroku config:set CLIENT_ID=1234567809fdsnfj`

There is an additional two env vars to set:
`FINAL_URI` - This is the Url which will be loaded if authorisation and the token request is succesful. 
A spotify Token will be returned to this Url as a QueryString parameter. This token can be parsed and then used to in subsequent requests to the Spotify Api.

`STATEKEY` - The name given to the cookie used during auth. This doesn't require change from `spotify_auth_state`

## Running locally
With the Env vars configured in a .env file, the app can be started locally `node index.js`

## Deploying the Express Application
The Express application to a Node.js environment such as Heroku, plese see above note about setting environment variables.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Usage / flow
Once hosted, from another application you can:

* Redirect a user to the login route (https://myspotauth/login)
* A cookie will be stored locally and the user will be re-directed to the Spotify login page
* On succesful authentication, the callback Url will be called (https://myspotauth/callback)
* After checking everything ties up, a token request will be made
* If successful the user will be redirected to the FINAL_URL with a token in the Query string
* This token can be parsed and used to make subsequent requests to the Api

> **Note**: There is currently no functionality within this token swap for requesting Refresh tokens.
